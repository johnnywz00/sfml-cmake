!! make older mac and windows versions?
!!curently the CopyResources step will copy .piko files to builds
file(COPY "${source_dir}/"
      DESTINATION "${dest_dir}"
      PATTERN "*.piko" EXCLUDE
)
?? make mac .app;  would put resources/ folder within .app/Contents/MacOS (so peer to exec.)

couldn't do ZBilliards/ZBilliards through Mac runner: damaged executable. ZBilliardsf/ZBilliards worked

linux wouldn't compile code that mac did: but setting compiler to clang++/libc++ caused compatibility issues w GLIBC etc.
